      "Love this restaurant and still mourn the closing of the LA spot. The best pastas and a perfect place to have lunch that \"feels\" like NYC! Very traditional and located very near the theater district, so you can hop in for an early dinner pre-show as well. You really can't go wrong ordering everything on the menu but my last visit, I had them make me a simple pasta with tomatoes and basil.\n",

      "If tradition, quality service, and first-rate homemade pasta is your desire, then look no more. This place is simply the best in NYC. I've been here several times after stumbling on it last year. Wish I had found it earlier in my career; it would have made many of my previous visits to NYC even more satisfying to the palate -- and wallet. Love the family atmosphere.\n",

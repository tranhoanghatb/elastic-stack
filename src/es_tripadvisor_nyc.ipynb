      "The best pasta in the world lives in New York City - Scarpetta!  This restaurant was recommended by one of my friend who lives in the city. He said it’s a nice casual meal in NYC and it’s really good pasta.  We arrived on time at this restaurant but unfortunately the seats wasn’t ready for us. We sat at the bar and have some drinks.\n",

You absolutely must eat here if you come and visit. This place should be higher on your 'places to visit' list than Time's square, Liberty Island, Central Park etc.\n",

      "The pasta is the best I have had in the new york area. While everything is great, it is really the pasta that is unmatched. There is a reason why reservations are hard to get and the place is expensive too (yet worth the money). The food here has soul. I have been there more than once and I specially like going in a group of at least 4 so I get to try more items on the menu family style!.\n",
